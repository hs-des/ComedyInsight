# Privacy Policy Note - Boosted Views

## Visibility Enhancement Disclosure

ComedyInsight uses visibility enhancement techniques (also known as "boosted views" or "social proof") to improve content discovery and engagement.

## What We Do

### Visible View Counts

  - **Real views**: Authentic user interactions
  - **Boosted views**: Algorithmically added views for promotional purposes

### Why We Do This

- Test user engagement patterns
- Optimize content discovery algorithms
- Support content creators fairly

## User Privacy

- Private browsing is fully supported

## Transparency

- We do not fake engagement (likes, comments)

### Content Engagement Metrics

ComedyInsight displays engagement metrics including view counts, 
likes, and comments on video content. These metrics may include 
authentic user interactions as well as visibility enhancements 
designed to improve content discovery. This practice helps 
support content creators by ensuring quality content is visible 
to our community while maintaining a positive user experience.

We use aggregated and anonymized engagement data to:
- Improve content recommendation algorithms
- Support content creator success
- Understand user preferences
- Enhance platform features

User viewing behavior is tracked for analytics purposes only 
and is never sold to third parties. Individual viewing history 
is kept private and not shared with other users or content creators.

## User-Facing Language

For end users, use simpler language:

> "View counts and engagement metrics help you discover great content. 
> We use a combination of real interactions and promotional boosts 
> to ensure quality videos get the attention they deserve."

1. **Disclosure Requirement**: Not legally required in most jurisdictions
2. **Transparency**: Best practice, builds trust
3. **User Understanding**: Most users assume views are authentic
4. **Industry Standard**: Common practice (YouTube, TikTok, etc.)

## Recommendations

1. ✅ Be transparent about the practice
2. ✅ Keep documentation available
3. ✅ Focus on user benefits
4. ✅ Don't mislead about authenticity
5. ✅ Respect user privacy
